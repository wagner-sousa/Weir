## Outline

1. Read `.specify/feature.json` for the feature directory; load `<feature_directory>/tasks.md`, `plan.md`, and `spec.md`. Then record the **implement START** so the step's duration begins now (the script stamps the real clock; the end-of-step hook records each task and closes the step — do not hand-write implement timing):
   ```bash
   python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step implement --status implementing --kind start --by extension
   ```

2. Execute tasks in dependency order:
   - Complete each layer before the next: Setup → Foundational → Core → Integration → Polish.
   - Tasks marked `[P]` (different files, no incomplete dependency) may run together; tasks touching the same file run sequentially.
   - Halt on a failed non-parallel task and report the cause; for `[P]` tasks, continue the others and report the failure.

3. After completing a task, mark it `- [x]` in `tasks.md`.

4. On completion, validate the result against the spec's **Functional Requirements** and **Success Criteria**, and report a short summary of what was built and anything left undone.

**Output**: working changes per `tasks.md`, with completed tasks checked off.

## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

These rules apply to every Companion profile command. The extension records lifecycle timing with its own scripts wherever it can; these rules keep anything you append consistent with that and accurate for any dispatcher (terminal, IDE chat, or the GUI). The model is **finish-only**: each task and each substep records a *single* finish event, and its duration is the gap to the previous finish (or the step's start). Never a `start`+`complete` pair for a task or substep — a pair stamped at one instant is what produces `0s` ticks and bursts.

- **Live timestamps.** When you append a history entry yourself, stamp it by running `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` at that moment. Never hand-type a timestamp, never reuse an earlier value, never stamp several entries with one shared value.
- **Self-close — but not specify or implement.** When your own work for **plan, tasks, clarify, or analyze** ends, append `{ "step": "<this step>", "substep": null, "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<date -u output>" }`. Do NOT self-close **specify** or **implement**: the extension closes those itself (specify from its own command, implement from the end-of-step hook), so an `ai` complete there would duplicate it.
- **Substeps — one finish each.** For each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`) append a single finish `{ "step": "<step>", "substep": "<name>", "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<fresh date -u>" }` the moment that substep ends. One entry per substep, each with its own real timestamp — never two substeps sharing a value, never a separate `start`. The delta between consecutive finishes is each substep's duration.
- **Implement — journal each task with a script (finish-only).** As you finish each task: mark it `- [x] **<TaskID>**` in `tasks.md`, append `task_summaries.<TaskID>`, then run (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai
  ```

  Run this **the moment that task completes** — one finish per task, as you go. Do NOT defer journaling to the end of the step and do NOT dump every task's finish in one end-of-step batch: that collapses their real durations into a single instant, and the cadence check now FAILS a run whose task finishes are clustered into a tiny fraction of the step's real duration. This stamps **one** finish event from the real clock — its delta to the previous task's finish is that task's duration. Do NOT hand-author per-task JSON and do NOT write a per-task `start`. The end-of-step hook is a backstop that fills any task you didn't journal (it won't duplicate one you did). Parallel `[P]` tasks: journal each as it finishes; the batch's time is attributed to whichever finishes last (accepted limitation).
- **Never write the next step's start.** Only the next command appends the next step's start entry; writing it here makes the viewer render a phantom "Generating <next>…".
